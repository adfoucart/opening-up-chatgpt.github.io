# How to contribute 

Every project is a separate file. The file some fields with contains basic metadata and then a set of triples of `_class`, `_link` and `_notes`. Class can be one of three values: 游릴 open, 游릲 partial or 游린 closed (leave empty to signify NA). Link is a URL providing evidence for the openness classification. Notes provide context and reasoning for the classification.
