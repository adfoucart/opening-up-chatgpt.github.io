# availability:
opencode:
    class: closed
    link: 
    notes: Mistral has limited source code available, also no training code for Geitje found

llmdata:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/Rijgersberg/GEITje-7B#geitje--trained-further-on-dutch-texts
    notes: Mistral provides no documentation of any of its pretraining data. Geitje Ultra 7B is based on Geitje 7B, which does disclose that Dutch pretraining data includes Gigacorpus and MADLAD.

    notes: Some information on architecture provided in github repo and HF model card

preprint:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12852v1
    notes: Preprint documents Dutch language resources but architecture and scientific documentation otherwise lacking due to Mistral base

    notes: No peer-reviewed paper found

modelcard:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/BramVanroy/GEITje-7B-ultra
    notes: Modelcard on HF provides information on fine-tuning but nothing for the Mistral base LLM

    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BramVanroy/ultra_feedback_dutch
    notes: Datasheet available for DPO and for the Dutch portions of pretraining data, but not for original Mistral pretraining data, hence partial.
