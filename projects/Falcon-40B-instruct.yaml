# availability:
opencode:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct
    notes: No source code shared, even though the term "open source" is used.

llmdata:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb
    notes: From the documentation 'The key ingredient for the high quality of the Falcon models is their training data, predominantly based (>80%) on RefinedWeb â€” a novel massive web dataset based on CommonCrawl' (https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon). However, only a small sample is made available.

llmweights:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct/tree/main
    notes: Model weights available through HuggingFace library

rldata:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot
    notes: RL data inherited from Baize but provenance not well-documented. From the documentation 'Falcon-40B-Instruct was finetuned on a 150M tokens from Baize mixed with 5% of RefinedWeb data.'

rlweights:
    class: closed
    link: https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot#v1
    notes: No RL weights or checkpoints made available

license:
    class: open
    link:
    notes: First release came with a legally murky license that was swiftly criticised and now generates a 404. Current documentation 'Falcon-40B-Instruct is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.'

# documentation
code:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: No source code found, therefore no documentation found.

architecture:
    class: partial
    link:
    notes: Architecture sketched on HuggingFace as "Falcon-40B-Instruct is a 40B parameters causal decoder-only model built by TII based on Falcon-40B and finetuned on a mixture of Baize."

preprint:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116
    notes: Preprint covers the creation and curation of RefinedWeb dataset, but not other aspects of the model, hence partial.

paper:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: No peer-reviewed paper known.

modelcard:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct
    notes: Model card on HuggingFace is mostly used to advertise the model, not to document its training and evaluation details.

datasheet:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: There is no datasheet available.

# access
package:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: There is no package.

api:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct
    notes: There is no API, and HuggingFace inference API is disabled for this model.
