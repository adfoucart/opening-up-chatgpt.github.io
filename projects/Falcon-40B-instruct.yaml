llmdata:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb
    notes: From the documentation 'The key ingredient for the high quality of the Falcon models is their training data, predominantly based (>80%) on RefinedWeb â€” a novel massive web dataset based on CommonCrawl' (https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon). However, only a small sample is made available.

llmweights:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct/tree/main
    notes: Model weights available through HuggingFace library

rldata:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot
    notes: RL data inherited from Baize but provenance not well-documented. From the documentation 'Falcon-40B-Instruct was finetuned on a 150M tokens from Baize mixed with 5% of RefinedWeb data.'

license:
    class: open

    notes: First release came with a legally murky license that was swiftly criticised and now generates a 404. Current documentation 'Falcon-40B-Instruct is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.'

preprint:
    class: partial
