    notes: OpenChat notes 'We are a student team from Tsinghua University'

# availability:
opencode:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/tree/master/ochat
    notes: Repository offers a large amount of fairly well-organized code for data curation and model

llmdata:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: Data for Llama2 is nowhere disclosed or documented, and described only in the vaguest terms in a corporate preprint released by Meta

llmweights:
    class: partial
    link: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/
    notes: Download of Llama2-13B is only possible after requesting access; requires signing a consent form

rldata:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: Preprint says shareGPT dataset "collected from sharegpt.com" but not disclosed or made available by this project

rlweights:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/tree/master/ochat
    notes: Actual instruction-tuned model weights hard to find, perhaps only available through package or API

license:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/blob/master/LICENSE
    notes: Code released under Apache 2.0 but usage requires signing Meta's bespoke 'community license', not an OSI recognised open license

# documentation:
code:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/tree/master/ochat
    notes: There is plenty of code in the github repository but only some of it is documented

architecture:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11235
    notes: Architecture quite well described in preprint

preprint:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11235
    notes: Preprint describes the model architecture and instruction tuning approach, though is hampered by building on notoriously closed Llama2

    class: closed
    link:
    notes: No peer-reviewed paper found

modelcard:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat_v3.2
    notes: There is a model card that provides some details on architecture and evaluation

datasheet:

    notes: Datasheet not provided.

# access:
package:
    class: open
    link: https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/tree/master#installation
    notes: Python package 'ochat' provided through pip

api:
    class: partial
    link:
    notes: Model too large to load onto HuggingFace free inference API, so only available through Inference Endpoints or package
