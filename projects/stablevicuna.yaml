    notes: All datasets are available and linked. StableVicuna-13B is fine-tuned on a mix of three datasets. OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1), a human-generated, human-annotated assistant-style conversation corpus consisting of 161443 messages distributed across 66497 conversation trees, in 35 different languages; GPT4All Prompt Generations, a dataset of 400k prompts and responses generated by GPT-4; and Alpaca, a dataset of 52000 instructions and demonstrations generated by OpenAI's text-davinci-003 engine.

    notes: Model not functional out of the box as weights require a delta computation. From the docs 'StableVicuna-13B cannot be used from the CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights alone. To obtain the correct model, one must add back the difference between LLaMA 13B and CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights.'

    notes: From the documentation 'The reward model used during RLHF was also trained on OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1) along with two other datasets Anthropic HH-RLHF, a dataset of preferences about AI assistant helpfulness and harmlessness; and Stanford Human Preferences Dataset a dataset of 385K collective human preferences over responses to questions/instructions in 18 different subject areas, from cooking to legal advice.'

    notes: Code is minimally documented and deployment requires non-trivial configuration, e.g. 'StableVicuna-13B cannot be used from the CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights alone. To obtain the correct model, one must add back the difference between LLaMA 13B and CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights.'
