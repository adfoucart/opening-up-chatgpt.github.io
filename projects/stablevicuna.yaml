    notes: StableVicuna-13B is a Vicuna-13B v0 model fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on various conversational and instructional datasets

opencode:
    class: partial

    notes: Some elements of the code made available through HuggingFace

llmdata:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta
    notes: Based on LLaMA whose pretraining data has nowhere been disclosed or documented.

llmweights:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta#apply-delta-weights
    notes: Model not functional out of the box as weights require a delta computation. From the docs 'StableVicuna-13B cannot be used from the CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights alone. To obtain the correct model, one must add back the difference between LLaMA 13B and CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights.'

    notes: From the documentation 'The reward model used during RLHF was also trained on OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1) along with two other datasets Anthropic HH-RLHF, a dataset of preferences about AI assistant helpfulness and harmlessness; and Stanford Human Preferences Dataset a dataset of 385K collective human preferences over responses to questions/instructions in 18 different subject areas, from cooking to legal advice.'

    notes: The HuggingFace community page has an open question for release of the RL model

    notes: CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0. License for LLaMA is more murky, hence partial. As they say 'License for the base LLaMA model's weights is Meta's non-commercial bespoke license.'

    notes: Code is minimally documented and deployment requires non-trivial configuration, e.g. 'StableVicuna-13B cannot be used from the CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights alone. To obtain the correct model, one must add back the difference between LLaMA 13B and CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta weights.'
