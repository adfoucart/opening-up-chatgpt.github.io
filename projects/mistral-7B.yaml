# availability:
opencode:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src
    notes: repository provides 'minimal code to run our 7B model'

llmdata:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: No information provided on pretraining data

llmweights:

    notes: Base LLM model made available for download

rldata:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
    notes: No information provided expect that instruction tuning is done using an unspecified 'variety of publicly available conversation datasets'

rlweights:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/tree/main

# documentation:
code:
    class: closed
    link: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src
    notes: the little code that is available is uncommented and undocumented
