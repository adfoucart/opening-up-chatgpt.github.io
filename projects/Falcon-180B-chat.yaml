# availability:
opencode:
    class: closed
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat
    notes: No source code shared anywhere. The over 200 github repositories of TII appear to include no LLM or Falcon related code.

llmdata:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb
    notes: From the documentation 'The key ingredient for the high quality of the Falcon models is their training data, predominantly based (>80%) on RefinedWeb â€” a novel massive web dataset based on CommonCrawl' (https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon). However, only a small sample is made available.

llmweights:

    notes: No details provided beyond "finetuned on a mixture of Ultrachat, Platypus and Airoboros".

rlweights:
    class: partial

    notes: Released under Falcon 180B TII license (not OSI approved) and a separate "acceptable use policy".

# documentation
code:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: No code available, so no code documented.

architecture:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat#model-architecture-and-objective
    notes: Architecture described as  "causal decoder-only" and "optimized for inference", but very few details available.

preprint:
    class: partial
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116
    notes: Preprint covers the creation and curation of RefinedWeb dataset, but not other aspects of the model, hence partial.

    notes: No peer-reviewed paper known.

modelcard:
    class: partial
