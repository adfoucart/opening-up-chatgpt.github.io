llmdata_notes,"All datasets are available and linked. StableVicuna-13B is fine-tuned on a mix of three datasets. OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1), a human-generated, human-annotated assistant-style conversation corpus consisting of 161,443 messages distributed across 66,497 conversation trees, in 35 different languages; GPT4All Prompt Generations, a dataset of 400k prompts and responses generated by GPT-4; and Alpaca, a dataset of 52,000 instructions and demonstrations generated by OpenAI's text-davinci-003 engine."
