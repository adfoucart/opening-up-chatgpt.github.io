    notes: 

llmdata:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: Based on Llama2, which means pretraining data is nowhere disclosed or documented, and described only in the vaguest terms in a corporate preprint released by Meta

llmweights:
    class: partial
    link: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/
    notes: Download only after requesting access; requires signing a consent form

rldata:
    class: open
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback
    notes: UltraFeedback dataset made available along with model release

rlweights:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/UltraLM-13b-v2.0
    notes: Online materials appear to be in flux and several HuggingFace links generate 404 errors, hence partial

    notes: No peer-reviewed paper found

modelcard:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/openbmb/UltraLM-13b#model-details
    notes: Model card on HuggingFace available for 13b (Llama1) model, but not for newer releases, hence partial
