  		<p>There is a growing amount of instruction-tuned text generators billing themselves as 'open source'. How open are they really?

  <p>Liesenfeld, Andreas, Alianda Lopez, and Mark Dingemanse. 2023. “Opening up ChatGPT: Tracking Openness, Transparency, and Accountability in Instruction-Tuned Text Generators.” In <em>Proceedings of CUI’23</em>. Eindhoven. doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3571884.3604316">10.1145/3571884.3604316</a>.</p>

	<h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>Our paper makes the following contributions:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>We review the risks of relying on proprietary software, from blackboxed processes to vendor lock-in and corporate capture of collective intelligence </li>
	<li>We review best practices for open, transparent and accountable AI</li>
	<li>We find over 15 ChatGPT alternatives (and counting) at varying degrees of openness, development and documentation</li>
	<li>We argue that tech is never a <em>fait accompli</em>: there was never a better time for critical and constructive work in this space, and open initiatives will play a key role here</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We find the following recurrent patterns:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Many projects inherit data of dubious legality</li>
	<li>Few projects share the all-important instruction-tuning</li>
	<li>Preprints are rare, peer-reviewed papers even rarer</li>
	<li>Synthetic instruction-tuning data is on the rise, with unknown consequences that are in need of research</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We conclude as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>"Openness is not the full solution to the scientific and ethical challenges of conversational text generators. Open data will not mitigate the harmful consequences of thoughtless deployment of large language models, nor the questionable copyright implications of scraping all publicly available data from the internet. However, openness does make original research possible, including efforts to build reproducible workflows and understand the fundamentals of LLM + RLHF architectures. Openness also enables checks and balances, fostering a culture of accountability for data and its curation, and for models and their deployment. We hope that our work provides a small step in this direction."
