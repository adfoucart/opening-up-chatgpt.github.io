## Contributing issues

We track models to add using Issues, and add them to the list using Pull Requests 
(resolving the issues). Before you add an issue, please check whether the model is 
already listed. Before you add a PR, please check whether someone else is already 
working on the issue.

## Contributing PRs

We value Pull Requests that address existing issues. If you're looking to contribute, 
a good way is to check the list of open issues and see if you can contribute missing data. 
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Cover all dimensions of the Openess list
- Document and motivate your choices for degrees of openness

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
